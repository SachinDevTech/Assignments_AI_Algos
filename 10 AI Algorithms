As of my last update in September 2021, here are ten of the most commonly used AI algorithms, along with brief descriptions of each:

1. Linear Regression:
   Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm used for supervised learning tasks. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values. It is widely used for tasks like predicting house prices, stock market trends, and more.

2. Logistic Regression:
   Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a categorical outcome. It is suitable for problems where the dependent variable has two possible classes. Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification, not regression, algorithm.

3. **Decision Trees:**
   Decision trees are popular algorithms for both classification and regression tasks. They create a tree-like model where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, making them useful for complex decision-making processes.

4. **Random Forest:**
   Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. It builds multiple trees using random subsets of the data and features and then averages their predictions to make the final decision.

5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
   SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points into different classes, maximizing the margin between them. SVM is especially useful for tasks with high-dimensional feature spaces.

6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
   KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It classifies data points by finding the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors (data points with the most similar features). KNN works well for smaller datasets but may become computationally expensive for larger ones.

7. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):**
   Artificial Neural Networks are the building blocks of deep learning. They are inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons and are designed to model complex relationships in data. Deep learning, using ANNs, has shown impressive performance in various tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and playing games.

8. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):**
   CNNs are a specialized type of neural network designed for processing grid-like data, such as images and videos. They use convolutional layers to automatically extract relevant features from the input data, making them highly effective for tasks like image recognition and object detection.

9. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):**
   RNNs are designed to work with sequential data, where the order of inputs matters. They have feedback connections that allow information to persist, making them suitable for tasks like natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series prediction.

10. **Genetic Algorithms:**
    Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They work by iteratively evolving a population of candidate solutions through processes like selection, crossover, and mutation. These algorithms are commonly used in optimization and search problems.

It's important to note that the field of AI is rapidly evolving, and newer algorithms and techniques may have emerged since my last update. Additionally, the popularity and usage of specific algorithms can vary depending on the problem domain and the advancements in AI research and technology.
